# DarkoASM
An assembler written in C++ for the Hack computer
## What is the Hack computer?
It's a simple, Harvard architecture machine, which everyone can implement in the Nand to Tetris course. Writing an assembler for the Hack machine language is part of the course
## Why do I share my own assembler?
Writing DarkoASM was an interesting and fun challenge. I feel like the results are worth sharing
## Can I contribute to the code or report an issue?
Yes, of course! Any contributions, bug reports and suggestions are welcome!
